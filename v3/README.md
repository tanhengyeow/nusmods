NUSMods Wiki
==

#### Proposed Level of Achievement: Gemini

However, we would still work towards Apollo 11 if time permits us to implement additional features on top of what will be built.

#### Problem motivation

Information about NUS modules can come from official NUS sources or through other platforms like blog posts, youtube etc. Currently, NUSMods has a dedicated module page for each module, showing reviews, module information and timetables. However, users need to search for other resources about the modules on their own as these information is scattered over the internet.

#### Project Scope/Aim

As a solution to this problem, we would like to create a wiki platform where students are able to collaborate and share resources with regards to a module.

This initiative would allow users to quickly obtain information about a respective module. The focus of this platform is to include more user-generated content that is editable by non-technical users. Each module would have a wiki page with some static content obtained from the NUSMods API and the rest of the content would be maintained and updated by students/lecturers.

#### Target Audience

- Members of NUS
--Students
--Lecturers
--Alumnus


#### User Stories

1) As a user who wants to gain more information about a module to gain more knowledge/practice, I want to obtain module related resources easily
2) As a user who had obtain relevant information and benefitted from the platform, I want to be able to give back to the community
3) As a user who uses this medium, I want a simple interface to post my resources and search for relevant module information easily
4) As a user who likes to help others, I wish my contribution is recognised and would help others in future
5) As a moderator who wants to prevent misuse of the platform, I want to be able to identify the abusers, warn or ban them if they continue causing problems
